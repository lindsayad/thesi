CITATIONS FOR HEAT, MOMENTUM, AND NEUTRAL MASS TRANSPORT

Plasma Medicine citations

@article{Kong2009b,
abstract = {This introductory review on plasma health care is intended to provide the interested reader with a summary of the current status of this emerging field, its scope, and its broad interdisciplinary approach, ranging from plasma physics, chemistry and technology, to microbiology, biochemistry, biophysics, medicine and hygiene. Apart from the basic plasma processes and the restrictions and requirements set by international health standards, the review focuses on plasma interaction with prokaryotic cells (bacteria), eukaryotic cells (mammalian cells), cell membranes,DNAetc. In so doing, some of the unfamiliar terminology—an unavoidable by-product of interdisciplinary research—is covered and explained. Plasma health care may provide a fast and efficient new path for effective hospital (and other public buildings) hygiene— helping to prevent and contain diseases that are continuously gaining ground as resistance of pathogens to antibiotics grows. The delivery of medically active ‘substances’ at the molecular or ionic level is another exciting topic of research through effects on cell walls (permeabilization), cell excitation (paracrine action) and the introduction of reactive species into cell cytoplasm. Electric fields, charging of surfaces, current flows etc can also affect tissue in a controlled way. The field is young and hopes are high. It is fitting to cover the beginnings in New Journal of Physics, since it is the physics (and non- equilibrium chemistry) of room temperature atmospheric pressure plasmas that have made this development of plasma health care possible.},

Plasma disinfection of organics

@article{Joubert2013a,
abstract = {Spores are dormant units of bacteria resistant to numerous disinfection methods. Additionally, the effects on bacteria of repetitive electrical discharges in water by used of the so-called "corona discharges" or streamer are poorly described. In this study vegetative and spore forms of Bacillus subtilis var. niger were subjected to these discharges. To generate corona discharges in water, a Marx generator capable of delivering 60-90 kV was used with a coaxial chamber of treatment. Vegetative and spore form reductions were defined using colony-forming unit counting. Proteins extracts were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and spots of interest were characterized by mass spectrometry. Shock waves were assessed by the diminution of liposome size and OD(400 nm). The results show a decrease in bacteria viability of 2 log(10) after 1000 discharges on the vegetative form and 4 log(10) after 10,000 discharges on the spores. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that the streamers impact the regulation of several proteins in the vegetative forms with UniProt ID: P80861, Q06797, P80244, C0ZI91, respectively. The reduction appears to be due, in part, to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) generated by the corona discharges while spore deactivation remained insensitive to these chemicals. The spore eradication was associated to shock waves induced by the discharges but not H(2)O(2). Corona discharges appear as a prospective method for eradication of spores in water. The corona discharges can be an efficient method for decontamination processes of waste water.},

Plasma disinfection of inorganics

@article{Johnson2006,
abstract = {Experiments have yielded a number of important insights into the energy distribution, sparging and oxidation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, m- and p-xylene, and o-xylene (BTEX) in a dense medium plasma reactor (DMPR). It has been found that the DMPR transferred a relatively small amount of electrical energy, approximately 4\% in the form of sensible heat, to the surrounding bulk liquid. Rate constants associated with plasma initiated oxidation, interphase mass transfer and photolysis were determined using a combination of non-linear least squares analysis and Matlab optimization for each species. The rate constants developed for the DMPR, in conjunction with a species mass balance on a prototype tubular high-density plasma reactor, have been applied to determine the removal rates of MTBE and the BTEXs when operating in batch and continuous flow configurations. The dependence of contaminant concentration on parameters such as treatment time, the number of pin electrodes, electrode gap, and volumetric flow rate has been determined. It was found that, under various design specifications and operating conditions, the tubular high-density plasma reactor may be an effective tool for the removal of volatile organic compounds from aqueous solutions.},

abstract = {Indirect air dielectric barrier discharge in close proximity to water creates an acidified, nitrogen-oxide containing solution known as plasma-activated water (PAW), which remains antibacterial for several days. Suspensions of E. coli were exposed to PAWfor either 15 min or 3 h over a 7-day period after PAWgeneration. Both exposure times yielded initial antibacterial activity corresponding to a ∼5-log reduction in cell viability, which decreased at differing rates over 7 days to negligible activity and a 2.4-log reduction for 15 min and 3 h exposures, respectively. The solution remained at pH ∼2.7 for this period and initially included hydrogen peroxide, nitrate and nitrite anions. The solution composition varied significantly over this time, with hydrogen peroxide and nitrite diminishing within a few days, during which the antibacterial efficacy of 15 min exposures decreased significantly, while that of 3 h exposures produced a 5-log reduction or more. These results highlight the complexity of PAWsolutions where multiple chemical components exert varying biological effects on differing time scales.},

After the volume force has been calculated, the commercial FLUENT software is used to solve the airﬂow. Experimental axial velocity proﬁles outside the ground grid obtained with a hot-wire anemometer reasonably validate the simulation results.},

Diffuison coefficients

@article{Sakiyama2012b,
abstract = {We present a numerical model of a surface microdischarge (SMD) in humid air at atmospheric pressure. Our model includes over 50 species and 600 elementary reactions and consists of two, coupled well-mixed regions: a discharge layer with both charged and neutral species and an afterglow region consisting only of neutral species. Multiple time steps employed in our model enable capturing rapid dynamic behaviour in the discharge layer as well as the relatively slow diffusion and reaction in the afterglow. A short duration, high electric field is assumed to be excited at 10 kHz in the discharge region with power density maintained at 0.05Wcm−2. Among the predicted dominant species in the afterglow are O3,N2O5,N2O, HNO3,H2,NO3, H2O2, HNO2 and NO2. The results are in qualitative agreement with Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy. Our simulation results show that density of those reactive species continues to evolve significantly in time, even after ∼15 min of SMD exposure. This result suggests that SMD treatments on the order of minutes or less may involve significant neutral species concentration and flux transients, potentially affecting interpretation of results.},
