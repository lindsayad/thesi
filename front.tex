\begin{dedication}
This is dedicated to my Mom, Dad, and Sister. Without them, I would never have gotten here. They've supported me through the good times and the bad. I couldn't have been blessed with a more loving family. This degree means a lot, but they will always mean immeasurably more.

I would like to thank my whole dissertation committee for teaching me so much about my field. Special thanks goes to Dr. Graves for hosting me in his lab for a full year and for his invaluable recommendations for modeling plasma physics. His theoretical knowledge in our field is unmatched. My greatest thanks goes to Dr. Shannon, who has not only been the most fantastic academic advisor I could have ever asked for but also a tremendous friend. Our relationship is hopefully just beginning.

Thanks to Jessie Lindsay for being as big a participant in the first four years of my journey here as anyone. She saw through things that a lot of other people wouldn't have been able to and made me a much better person in the process. Thanks also to Kyle Weinfurther, David Peterson, and Ben Daniel for helping lift me out of a tough time that overlapped with the most important stage of my research.

Thanks to all the members of the Shannon and Graves group that I had a chance to work and hang out with, particularly Brandon Byrns who mentored me for my first two years, teaching me so much about the VHF source and atmospheric plasmas. Life's pretty good when your lab partner is also one of your closest friends.

I would like to thank Brandon Curtis for introducing me to the open source way of thinking. It's revolutionized my research and career plans in the best possible way. I know now that I can learn just about anything. Thanks also goes to Jannis Teunissen for greatly extending my knowledge of open source tools and for teaching me how to think about modelling problems. I sincerely hope we can collaborate in the future. Finally, deep thanks goes out to the Moose development team and community who have taught me so much about computer science, math, physics, and engineering. It's been a great ride.
