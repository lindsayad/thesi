\chapter{CONCLUSION \& FUTURE WORK}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This dissertation includes both modelling and experimental studies of plasma-liquid systems, however, the keystones of the plasma-liquid research are the modelling chapters, \cref{chap:basic_science,chap:zapdos}. \Cref{chap:basic_science} addresses a couple of fundamental questions of the plasma-liquid research community. \Cref{sec:plasfree_model} considers the role of convective fluid flow on transport processes in plasma-liquid systems. Through evaporative cooling, convection creates a significant difference in bulk temperatures (\~10 K) between gas and liquid phases.
